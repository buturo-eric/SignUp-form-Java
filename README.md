Java Login Form
This is a simple Java application that demonstrates how to implement a login form using Swing components and MySQL database. The application allows users to enter their credentials (username and password) and checks them against the stored records in the database. If the login is successful, the user is redirected to a welcome page, otherwise, an error message is displayed.
